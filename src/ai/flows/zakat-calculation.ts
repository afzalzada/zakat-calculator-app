  prompt: `You are an expert in Islamic finance, specializing in Zakat calculation according to different Madhabs.

  A user wants to calculate Zakat for a specific asset.
  - Asset Type: {{{assetType}}}
  - Value / Count: {{{value}}}
  - Madhab: {{{madhab}}}
  - User claims Hawl (1 Year) is met: {{{hawlMet}}}
  {{#if notes}}
  - Additional Notes: {{{notes}}}
  {{/if}}

  Your task is to calculate the Zakat liability for this single asset based on the user's input.

  - First, you must determine if the Nisab threshold is met. Use current market values for gold to establish the Nisab (the value of 85 grams of gold). For 'Silver', use the value of 595 grams of silver. For cash and cash-equivalent assets, it's common practice to use the gold Nisab. State the Nisab value you are using in your explanation.
  - For 'Agriculture', the Nisab is approximately 653 kg of produce. You should evaluate if the provided 'value' (which could be monetary value or quantity) meets this threshold.
  - 'Rikaz (Treasure)' has no Nisab requirement.
  - If the asset value is below the applicable Nisab, Zakat is not due. The zakatLiability must be 0, and the explanation should clearly state that the Nisab was not met and specify the threshold used.

  - Second, if Nisab is met, analyze the Hawl condition. If 'hawlMet' is false for assets that require it (Gold, Silver, Cash, Investments, Business Assets, Livestock), Zakat is not due. The zakatLiability must be 0, and the explanation should state this is the reason. Note: 'Agriculture' and 'Rikaz (Treasure)' do not have a Hawl requirement.

  If Zakat is due because both Nisab and Hawl conditions are met (where applicable):
  - For 'Gold', 'Silver', 'Cash & Savings', 'Investments', and 'Business Assets', the standard Zakat rate is 2.5%. For 'Business Assets', the value should be net current assets (inventory, receivables, cash) after deducting short-term liabilities.
  - For 'Agriculture' (Ushr), the Zakat rate is 10% on produce from naturally (rain) irrigated land and 5% from artificially irrigated land. Use the 'notes' field to determine the irrigation type if provided.
  - For 'Livestock' (An'am), the rules are specific to the type and number of animals. For example, for sheep/goats, the Nisab is 40 animals, and the Zakat is 1 sheep for 40-120 sheep. Use the 'notes' to understand the context. The 'value' field will represent the count of animals. The Zakat liability should be expressed in terms of the number and type of animals due, and then also provide an estimated monetary value. For the purpose of the 'zakatLiability' field in the output, provide the monetary value.
  - For 'Rikaz (Treasure)', the rate is a flat 20% of the value.

  Provide a clear and concise explanation for the result.
  - If Zakat is not due, explain which condition (Nisab or Hawl) was not met.
  - If Zakat is due, your explanation should include:
    1. The Nisab for the asset type and confirmation that it was met.
    2. Confirmation that the Hawl condition was met (if applicable).
    3. The Zakat rate applied.
    4. The final calculated Zakat amount.

  Return the total zakatLiability (as a number, without currency symbols) and a detailed explanation.
